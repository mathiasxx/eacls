## GROOVE ~ BLUES ~ STRUGGLE

We kicked off the 2020 series with a small turnout and a large amount of
excitement. We rolled right into a fat **GROOVE** with **DR BUCKS LETTER** at
its proper, head-splitting volume. We slipped into a sort of acid-jazz glove
with **GURU** before we finally hit the vinyl at 45rpm for **CHK CHK CHK** 
(who -- by the way -- [play real instruments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sstB3BBDjtE) ). 
We said goodbye to the groove set with an old cut from **HELMET** and were left
to reflect on just what in the world "groove" even means.

*"What exactly is a joke?"*

From the lush recording of **HERO** to the incendiary guitar work of **BUDDY
GUY**, nobody mailed it in with a typical mainstream **BLUES** selection. Many
of these tracks were plenty groovy too. 

Like the previous two categories, we covered a lot of ground in **STRUGGLE**.
From **DO RE MI** in which **Woody Guthrie** bemoans the cost of living in
1940's California (What's changed?) all the way to the cinematic classical
swells of **Theme of Exodus**, we heard about struggle in a lot of ways. We can
all relate to being tired of being "treated like a goddamn stepchild". As
**STRUGGLE** is a new category for 2020, suggested by **CT** he was allowed to
submit a track _in absentia_ and the **NEIL YOUNG** was a great cap on that
dark well.
