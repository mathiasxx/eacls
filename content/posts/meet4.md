## LOFI ~ BEAUTIFUL ~ COMBOS (TWO OR MORE ARTISTS TOGETHER)

_aka The Night We Took That Bevin Down_


**LOFI** was interpreted in different ways. Are we talking a purposely "low fi"
sound? A track recorded when recording was truly, low fidelity? A well recorded
track, but one that abstains from studio artifice? Or is it a simply recorded
track from any time period? We got the [inevitable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lo-fi_music) **Sebadoh** in the form of a
collage of samples that make up an interlude piece off a very early (first?) Lou
Barlow cassette release (see below for more on this track). We had a couple
spare 90's tracks, a couple of simply recorded folk tunes, and an eye/ear
opening Todd Rundgren deep cut, **Little Red Lights**.

Like LOFI, **BEAUTIFUL** is open to interpretation, easily meaning just about
anything to anyone. A couple people went for "nice sounding harmonies". We got a
controversial selection in **Brazil**. Not sure why that was controversial since
it is clearly a shining thing of beauty. The **Sonny Sharrock** was a standout
with its pretty head phrase and stand out bass solo.

Finally **COMBOS** rounded out the night. The **Mocking Bird** track by Hendrix and Dusty Springfield
was a treat (and a rarity -- [google it](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=hendix+springfield+mocking+bird&s=g) ).
We got an incredible sounding **Loftus** track, and a funny and supremely 
performed number from **Loretta Lynn and Conway Twitty**.

The **Sebadoh** track isn't numbered but the sampled classical theme shows up
throughout the album. The track we heard is most usually referenced as the
interlude between Sexual Confusion and Three Times a Day. See [this Low Barlow
interview](https://indieethos.wordpress.com/2012/01/16/sebadohs-lou-barlow-talks-beginning-with-weed-forestin-soon-to-be-reissued-on-lp-an-indie-ethos-exclusive-part-1-of-2/)
where he talks about not knowing what that classical sampled bit is. There is
some speculation that it is Wagner, but surprisingly I was unable to find an
answer to this burning question on the internets.
