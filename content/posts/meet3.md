Meeting three started with the spooky, cathedral level reverb of **Hard On for
Love**, wound it's way through a sick display from **Terminator X**, and ended up in
some sort of progrock/metal/smoothjazz dreamscape concocted by **Animals as Leaders**.

The **HAVING OR SUGGESTING SPATIAL EFFECT** theme was a great success with each
entry stimulating the imagination and revealing more room than we previously
thought possible in a musical selection. Especially surprising was the **My
Bloody Valentine** piece with so many of us not familiar with *that* sound from
them, and **Albuquerque** conjured a desert highway vista.

**(GOOD) SONG UNDER TWO MINUTES** was surprising because nobody produced a track
from **The Minutemen**. Instead we had a quick go around the room with deeply
architected selections from **The Frogs** and **Trevor Powers**. Hopefully
everyone is still humming **The Simple Song**. If you want more **Unwound**
check out [this show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMBkzLJr9dE) from 1993.

We wrapped with **TIGHT**. Clearly there is overlap between this category and
the short song one, with the double scored by (Louisville's own) **Malignant
Growth** wailing away on **Hopeless**. We almost lost a speaker cone to
**Combustion** and there was some debate about the amount of praise to heap on
**Keith Moon** of **The Who**. There was much grooving to the tight-ass bass of
the French House track by **Alan Braxe & Fred Falke**, and the sweet, sweet
Spanish muiscal love making of **Camaron de La Isla**.
