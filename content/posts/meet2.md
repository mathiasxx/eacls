## FEMALE VOX ~ POLITICAL ~ SAD

Meeting two started with a double dose of the incredible vocals of Nina Simone.
The *SAD* and *POLITICAL* categories, plus dark subject matter of **Strange
Fruit** conspired to set a somber tone for this edition of the Society meeting.
By the way, doesn't **Strange Fruit** hit all three categories-- female,
political, and sad? Everyone was surprised when it was revealed that **Silversun
Pickups** lead vocalist is actually a female! True fact. There was a strong 60s
and 70s vibe to this meeting which led to several, "that
_insert-backing-band-member-here_ player is amazing!". **Ohio/Machine Gun** and
**You Got The Love** come to mind. Predictably Bob Dylan was featured in the
*POLITICAL* chapter. But **Hinkley Had A Vision** generated good discussion, and
what a great sounding recording! The *SAD* chapter had everyone in tears. First
we had to relive the [Death of Sgt. Elias
scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEv3zzKyiFQ) from Platoon, then listen to
the miserable life circumstances that led to the selection of **Oh Girl**, and
finally contemplate the staggering devastation left in the wake of crack
cocaine.
