## LOUD/SOFT ~ SCARY ~ SLOW

The meeting got started a little late. From the opening, insistent drive of
*Lunacy* to the final spaced-out notes of *He Loved Him Madly* it was an exciting and
memorable experience. The startling immediacy of *Convenient Parking* was proof
that there is more to loud than mere volume. Or is just loud and louder? What
does *Knoxville Girl* say about the American psyche? Is there another song more
casually brutal in its subject matter? The progrock delight that is *The Great
Deceiver* reminded me of hours spent on subways and trains with **King Crimson**
in my CD Walkman. Back then I was completely into drums, but man, the bass lines
in that tune are something. And how about that **Talk Talk** track? That was a
real eye/ear opener for me. I look forward to spending some time with that
album. Vile by the **Melvins** was a real treat with it's spare recording and
pounding riff. Warning: the Spotify version of that **Melvins** album has
irritating trebliness (if that's even a word). We were all blown away by
performance of The *New Frisco Train*. There's early drone rock in them hills
(and early Flavor Flav). I think that *Veiled Undertow* was a contender for Most
Scary Track, as well as for Best Sounding Record. And what a surprise *Not To
Touch The Earth* was to our jaded ears. I mean, who even puts on **The Doors**
anyway? This track is a convincing argument that it's worth digging a little
deeper into their catalog.
